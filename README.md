## üöÄ Caching Strategy

- **TTL Caching on Medicine Lookup**:  
  Frequently queried medicine data during the `/coupon/applicable` call is cached with a time-to-live (TTL) strategy.  
  This reduces repeated database hits for common items and improves overall performance.

## üîí Concurrency Strategy

- **Row-Level Locking During Coupon Validation**:  
  To ensure correctness in multi-user scenarios, the system locks the row corresponding to the coupon usage when validating and updating the usage count.  
  This avoids race conditions and ensures data consistency when multiple users try to redeem the same coupon simultaneously.
